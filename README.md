## SmartGrow

Version 2 of the website created for my grade 9 Science Fair. 

Original sprinkler system made by Charles-Henri Chaki and Sparsh Nishit Shah, website made by Charles-Henri Chaki

## Project Overview

The SmartGrow irrigation system is a fully automatic sprinkler that uses a fusion of forecast and soil moisture data utilizing a custom machine-learning inspired algorithm. With over 15 user-tunable variables to customize, the sprinkler ensures flexibility and sustainability. It features a fully 3D-printed structure and can be produced in bulk for $20.
